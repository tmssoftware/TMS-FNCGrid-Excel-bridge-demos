# Templates

Here we show how to use an existing template to export a file.

## Concepts

- How to export to a TExcelFile object instead of directly to a file. If you export to a TExcelFile object, you can have data already loaded in it, and you can further customize the file properties before saving.

- How to insert rows into an existing file, instead of always creating a new file.

- How to use the ExportCell event to customize the generated file.
